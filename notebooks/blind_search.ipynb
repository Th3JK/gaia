    "## What is Blind Search?\n",
    "Blind Search is a simple optimization algorithm that tries to find the minimum value of a function by randomly sampling points in the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Does **not use gradients** or any knowledge of the function shape.\n",
    "- - Searches randomly within given bounds.\n",
    "- Records improvements when a better solution is found.\n",
    "- Stops if:\n",
    "  - a solution with function value `0` is found, or\n",
    "  - maximum iterations without improvement is reached."

    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the search space bounds and the function to minimize.\n",
    "2. Generate a random starting point and evaluate the function.\n",
    "3. Repeat until stopping criteria is met:\n",
    "   - Generate a new random point.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the function at that point.\n",
    "   - If the new value is lower than the current best, record it and reset the iteration counter.\n",
