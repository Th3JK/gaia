    "## What is Hill Climbing?\n",
    "Hill Climbing is an optimization algorithm that iteratively improves a solution by making small changes and moving toward better solutions, aiming to find the maximum (or minimum) value of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points**:\n",
    "- Uses local information: evaluates neighboring solutions to decide the next move.\n",
    "- Starts with an initial solution and explores nearby candidates.\n",
    "- Moves only if the new solution is better than the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stops if**:\n",
    "- a solution with optimal value (e.g., 0 for minimization) is found, or\n",
    "- no better neighbors exist (local maximum/minimum), or\n",
    "- maximum iterations are reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- Simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "- Can get stuck in local optima because it only looks at immediate neighbors.\n",
    "- Variants like stochastic hill climbing or simulated annealing try to overcome this limitation.\n"

    "1. Initialize the search space bounds and the function to optimize.\n",

    "3. Repeat until stopping criteria is met:\n",
    "    - Generate neighboring points around the current solution.\n",
    "    - Evaluate the function at each neighbor.\n",
    "    - If a neighbor has a better value than the current solution, move to that neighbor and reset the iteration counter.\n",
    "    - If no neighbor is better, stop (local optimum reached).\n",

    "- Hill Climbing is simple and uses local search to iteratively improve solutions.\n",
    "- Efficient for low- to medium-dimensional problems but can get stuck in local optima.\n",
    "- Works best when a good initial solution is available.\n",
    "- Benchmark functions allow standardized evaluation of performance.\n",
    "- The Animator class can visualize the optimization path and generate GIFs for presentations or analysis."
