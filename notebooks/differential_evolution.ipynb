    "## What is Differential evolution\n",
    "Differential Evolution is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by natural evolution. It evolves a population of candidate solutions using operations like mutation, crossover, and selection, aiming to find the global minimum (or maximum) of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "   - Population-based: maintains multiple candidate solutions simultaneously.\n",
    "   - Stochastic: uses randomness in mutation and crossover to explore the search space.\n",
    "   - Suitable for continuous, nonlinear, and non-differentiable problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stops if:**\n",
    "   - maximum generations (cycles) are reached, or\n",
    "   - the population has converged (no significant improvement), or\n",
    "   - the maximum number of function evaluations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "   - More robust than simple local search methods because it explores multiple solutions at once.\n",
    "   - Can handle complex landscapes with multiple local minima.\n",
    "   - Parameters like population size, mutation factor, and crossover probability affect performance."

    "## How Differential Evolution works\n",
    "1. Initialize the population: generate a set of candidate solutions uniformly within the search bounds.\n",
    "2. Repeat for each generation:\n",
    "    - Mutation: for each individual, create a mutant vector by combining other randomly selected individuals.\n",
    "    - Crossover: mix the mutant vector with the current individual to create a trial vector.\n",
    "    - Selection: if the trial vector performs better than the current individual (based on the objective function), replace the current individual with the trial.\n",
    "3. Record the population at each generation for analysis or visualization.\n",
    "4. Return the history of population states over generations."

    "- Maintains diversity in the population, reducing the risk of getting stuck in local minima.\n",
    "- Performance depends on proper choice of population size, mutation factor, crossover probability, and number of generations.\n",
    "- Benchmark functions and visualizations help analyze its behavior and convergence."
