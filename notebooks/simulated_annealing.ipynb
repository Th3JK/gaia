    "## What is Simulated Annealing?\n",
    "Simulated Annealing (SA) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It searches for a global minimum of a function by exploring the search space probabilistically, allowing occasional uphill moves to escape local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points**:\n",
    "- Does not require gradients; works with the function value only.\n",
    "- Uses a temperature parameter to control the probability of accepting worse solutions.\n",
    "- Allows occasional moves to worse solutions early on to avoid getting stuck in local minima.\n",
    "- Gradually reduces temperature, decreasing the likelihood of accepting worse solutions over time.\n",
    "- Stops when temperature is very low or maximum iterations are reached."

    "1. Initialize the search space bounds, the function to minimize, and starting temperature.\n",
    "2. Generate a random starting point and evaluate the function.\n",
    "3. Repeat until stopping criteria is met:\n",
    "    - Generate a new candidate solution (often by a small random change).\n",
    "    - Evaluate the function at this candidate.\n",
    "    - If the new solution is better, accept it.\n",
    "    - If the new solution is worse, accept it with probability:\n",
    "      $P = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta f}{T}}$\n",
    "      where $\\Delta f$ is the increase in function value and $T$ is the current temperature.\n",
    "    - Gradually decrease the temperature according to a cooling schedule.\n",
    "4. Return the best solution found."
