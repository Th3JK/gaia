## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gaia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## üì¶ Required Packages
This project relies on the following Python libraries (full list in requirements.txt):
- numpy 
- matplotlib 
- pillow 
- abc (standard library)
- plus other scientific and visualization tools.

---
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Each algorithm can be run against the provided test functions.
Animations of the optimization process are automatically saved into the assets/ directory.

Example entry point:
```python
from src import benchmark_algorithm
from src.algorithms.blind_search import BlindSearch

benchmark_algorithm(BlindSearch)
```
---
## üìù Notes

The code is created by a human, but the documentation was generated with the help of ChatGPT.

Animations of the optimization processes are saved as GIFs in the corresponding algorithm/function folders under assets/.
